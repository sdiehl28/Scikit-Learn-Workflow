    "# Basic Pandas and Scikit Learn Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first in a series of notebooks that demonstrate proper Machine Learning workflow using Pandas and Scikit Learn for supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Theme\n",
    "Never look at the test data!\n",
    "\n",
    "This seemingly obvious point has subtle implications when Pandas feature engineering and cross validation are employed.  Many beginners, and even a few experts, inadvertently write code that makes implicit use of test data resulting in an overly optimistic estimate of the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "This notebook assumes the reader has written at least some code in Python making use of Pandas and Scikit Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to help the reader put all these together to create Machine Learning models using best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was created in a development enviroment using the Anaconda distribution.  This notebook was created using the following versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python  3.6\n",
    "* Numpy  1.13\n",
    "* Pandas 0.22\n",
    "* Scikit Learn 19.1"

    "### Data Set and Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A common dataset used in beginning Machine Learning is the titantic dataset from Kaggle.  The goal is to predict who survived and who did not based on the other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will use \"train.csv\" as available from Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that \"test.csv\" is also provided by Kaggle.  This is a set of records without labels.  As this notebook is concerned with supervised learning only (not semi-supervised learning), test.csv will not be used at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question:\n",
    "Why am I disgregarding test.csv when even the tutorial writers over at Kaggle for this introductory competition make use of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Especially for a beginner, it is important not to learn bad practices up front.  In a supervised problem in real life, you will not have unlabeled data (making use of that is called semi-supervised learning).  Futhermore the very name of the file \"test.csv\" suggests you should not be looking at it.\n",
